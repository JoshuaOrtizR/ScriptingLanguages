**Core Concepts:**

* **Programming:** The process of creating instructions for computers to follow.
* **Programming Language:** A specific set of rules and syntax used to write these instructions.
* **Python:** A high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and versatility.
* **Interpreter:** A program that reads and executes Python code line by line.
* **Syntax:** The specific rules governing the structure of Python code.
* **Semantics:** The meaning and interpretation of Python code.
* **Variables:** Placeholders for storing data, like numbers or text.

**Building Blocks of Python:**

* **Keywords:** Reserved words with special meanings, such as `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, etc.
* **Identifiers:** Names given to variables, functions, and other objects in Python.
* **Operators:** Symbols used to perform operations, like `+` for addition, `-` for subtraction, `*` for multiplication, `/` for division, and `%` for modulo.
* **Data Types:** Different categories of data, such as `int` (integers), `float` (floating-point numbers), `str` (strings), `bool` (Boolean values), and more.
* **Expressions:** Combinations of values, variables, and operators that evaluate to a single value.
* **Statements:** Instructions that the Python interpreter executes, like assignment statements, control flow statements, and function definitions.

**Control Flow:**

* **Conditional Statements:** Used to make decisions based on conditions, such as `if`, `else`, and `elif`.
* **Loops:** Used to repeat blocks of code multiple times, such as `for` and `while` loops.

**Functions:**

* **Functions:** Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
* **Parameters:** Values passed to a function to customize its behavior.
* **Return Values:** Values returned by a function to the calling code.

**Modules and Packages:**

* **Modules:** Files containing Python code that can be imported into other Python programs.
* **Packages:** Collections of modules organized into directories.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

* **Classes:** Blueprints for creating objects.
* **Objects:** Instances of classes with their own attributes and methods.
* **Inheritance:** The ability of one class to inherit attributes and methods from another.
* **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects to take on many forms.
* **Encapsulation:** The bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit.

**SecAdmin Notes:**

* **IDE (Integrated Development Environment):** A software application that provides tools for writing, debugging, and running code.
* **Script:** A program designed to automate tasks or perform specific operations.
* **Input:** Data provided to a program.
* **Output:** Data generated by a program.
* **Error Handling:** Techniques for dealing with errors that may occur during program execution.
* **Debugging:** The process of finding and fixing errors in code.
* **Testing:** The process of verifying that code works as expected.
